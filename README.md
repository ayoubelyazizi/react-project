# Solo Project On REACT JS

This project was made by [**Ayoube El Yazizi**](https://github.com/ayoubelyazizi).

## What was asked ? 

I had to make a showcase site, so I decided to take the opportunity to train a bit in React and work with the creation of components to then implement them, I haven't used "state" in this project for the moment but I thought of using them later to make a multilingual site for example.

## What did i do ?

My client already had a website that he wanted to change, so I based my first design on the content of his current website.
Each part of my site is composed of different components that I imported and implemented afterwards in a single main file.
I used different javascript libraries, Next JS, Swiper JS etc.

## What works and what to do ?

Everything works but i didn't do the responsive part of the site for the moment. To test it you will have to clone it and download the necessary dependencies, which you can find on the file "package.json" then just run the command "npm run dev" and enjoy!

Ayoube.
